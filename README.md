# Monthly Planner
## San Jose State University<br />
## CMPE 172/ Spring 2020<br />
## Team-Nicholas Castro and Justin Magadia<br />
## Project Introduction<br />
This is a simple monthly planner applcation that lets users create events<br />
and see the events that they made. This application would ask a user to login <br />
before being able to access the calendar.
<br />
This project aims to provide a simple way for users to keep track of events<br />
that they planned. Tools used for this application are MySQL, Amazon RDS, <br />
Nodejs, and React. Tools that would have been implemented but were not due <br />
to difficulties and time constraints are Elastic Beanstalk using Docker to <br />
deploy the project as well as Springboot as a resting API. <br />

## Setup Pre-requisites
This project only runs locally so these are the pre-requisites to do so.<br />
You will need to have NodeJS installed on the system.<br />
Once this is done locate the directory in which the project is stored.<br />
From within this directory run command prompt and type the command "npm start".<br />
This will allow you to view our app in (http://localhost:3000) and view it in the browser.<br />
